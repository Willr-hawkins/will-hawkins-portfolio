      I'm a <span>Junior Web Developer</span> who loves turning ideas into
      functional, beautiful web applications. Based in Devon, I combine

      Whether it's streamlining a dog-walking business with automated bookings,
      creating secure e-commerce experiences, or supporting wildlife
      conservation through pro bono work, I'm driven by projects that have
      purpose. I work across the
      <span

        systems</span
      >
      and I'm always learning. Right now, I'm diving deep into React to add even
      more tools to my development toolkit.
